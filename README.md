# Material-Design-Lite Spinner

That fancy circle spinner that Google uses

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

```jsx
import MDLSpinner from 'patchkit-mdl-spinner'

<MDLSpinner />
```
## Styles

Use the .less file:

```less
@import "node_modules/patchkit-mdl-spinner/styles.less"
```

## License

This component is largely a wrapper around Google's original work, so I just decided to use their license as well.

Changes: The styles were converted from SASS to Less, and I added a React component.
